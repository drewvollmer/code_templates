-- conditional_pin.inp

-- Suppose that we have some file and we only want to pin it if it's nonempty. We can use the
-- "system" function to get the number of lines from a file using a bash command.  This assigns
-- to a variable, but it has spaces afterwards and is cast as a string, so we use "trim" to remove
-- spaces and then "number" to cast as a string:

-/lines=number(trim(system("wc -l < testfile.csv")))
-- Or:
-/lines=number(trim(system("cat testfile.csv | wc -l")))

-- And then use an if condition:
if lines gt 1
   $pin testfile.csv
end if
