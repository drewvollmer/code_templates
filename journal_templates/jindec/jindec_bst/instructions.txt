0. Download makebst.ins, makebst.dtx from https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/custom-bib

The remaining instructions are taken from the README at CTAN

1. Run TeX (or LaTeX) on makebst.ins (--> makebst.tex) [Note: command prompt on Windows]
2. Run TeX (or LaTeX) on makebst.tex to start customizing
     your own .bst file. Select merlin as the master file (default) when
     asked. (I have other master files for my own purposes.)
3. Answer the questions that then arise; for merlin, you will also be asked
     which language support file you want (default is merlin itself, meaning
     English or the pseudo-language Babel). You will also be asked if you want
     to add a file defining short-hand designations for various journals; such
     files are included (physjour.mbs, geojour.mbs, photjour.mbs) for physics
     geophysics, and optics journals, but you could create your own.
4. The menus that appear may not be informative enough for you. More
     information can be obtained by reading the documentation (on the options)
     contained in the .mbs files themselves. This documentation can be printed
     out by running LaTeX on the .mbs files.
5. The makebst program only produces a docstrip batch job to generate the .bst
     file. The last question it asks is whether that job should be run right
     away. You can always run it again yourself by running TeX or LaTeX on
     this .dbj file. (The .dbj file can also be manually edited if you want to
     play around with the various options it includes.)


This reference is also useful:

If you botch it, you can edit the dbj file.  Just comment the wrongly
selected option and uncomment the desired option (defaults are not
commented by default).  Then latex [file].dbj.
